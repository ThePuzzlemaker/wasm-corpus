# wasm-corpus

A corpus of some "real-world" WASM files used in production, as well as some other examples.

I created this as I needed a relatively large amount of WASM code to do some analysis on "real" code, but could not find any large amounts of WASM that were not e.g. fuzzer-generated.

## Licensing

This dataset itself is licensed under CC0-1.0. **However, the code contained within is not necessarily public domain or open source. Please consult the origin of the code for licensing information before using the code as anything more than an analysis target.**

If you are the copyright owner of one of these files and would like me to remove it from this repository, I will be willing to remove it. I will likely just replace it with a link as these files are publicly available anyway.

In the future I may just change this all to a bunch of links and a script to wget them all.

TL;DR please don't sue me thx
